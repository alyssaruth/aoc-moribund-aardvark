# Advent of Code 2024

Solutions to 2024's Advent of Code, written in Haskell. Forked from RaphaelColman's excellent repo [here](https://github.com/RaphaelColman/AdventOfCodeTemplate)

To run:
```
❯ stack ghci
...

λ> aoc1
Solution:
1602
Solution:
1633
```

This is good for trialling solutions, because `:r` will reload your changes. You can also use the `printTestSolutions` function to use inputs from /res/test_inputs instead

Alternatively, you can build and run the application completely
```
❯ stack build
❯ stack exec aoc-moribund-aardvark-exe
